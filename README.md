My final project in NLP & AI course - An automatic customer service response system (bot) using weka API in JAVA.
The system will receive inquiries from customers and respond to inquiries with a relevant answer to the customer's request. The system will receive the customers' questions as input, perform classification for them and give a relevant answer according to the classification of the question asked.
